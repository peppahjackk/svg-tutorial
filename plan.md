# Dev & Tell - SVGs

## TO DO
[] - Slides animation iframe

## Talking points

1. Why you should be using them
  - Scalability
  - Fileweight
  - Malleable
    - fill/stroke
    - animate stroke

2. Integrating into HTML
  - Inline vs ext
    - Inline
      - Pros: Able to edit paths via code, reduces file downloads
      - Cons: Doesn't Cache, messier code
    - External
      - Pros: Cleaner code, browser will cache them
      - Cons: Cannot edit path stroke, color, etc, 1 DL req per

3. Styling your asset
  - Inline
    - Harder to override
    - More contained
  - Class based
    - Separation of concerns
    - Easier to target

4. Converting asset into svg
* Naming convention
  - Sketch
    1. Select Icon
    2. Set X/Y to 0/0
    3. Export
    4. Clean up
      - Remove XML tag (we'lld be integrating), xlink attribute (deprecated), generated by (extra), desc (extra)
  - Illustrator
    - If you need to separate paths, make changes
    1. Select paths (object -> compound path -> release as needed)
    2. Ensure units are set to pixels
    3. File -> Export As
      - Styling
      - Font
      - Uncheck minify/responsive

5. Animating your asset
  - Basic animations (entire svg)
    - Rotate, Bounce, opacity, color
  - Line draw
  - Mask reveal
    - Clippy for path reveal
  - Interior el animation
    - Coordinate systems
    - Transform origin - relative to entire 
      - find point in illustrator/ps

6. Triggering your animation
  - On click
  - On hover
  - On load
  - On view

7. Gotchas
  - Text in svg
  - Clip-path in IE (stroke array as well?)
  - Fallbacks


## Output
circle plus
  - illustrator break up
  - prototypical inheritance
  - anime in general
  - config duration
  - relative values
  - tgt inner svg path
    - coordinate systems
    - transform origin
  - elasticity
  - on begin/complete animating
pin animation
  - anime timeline
  - anime keyframes
    - start value workaround
Nurse line draw
